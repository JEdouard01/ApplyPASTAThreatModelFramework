<h1>Apply the PASA Threat Model Framework</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of performing a threat model using the PASTA framework for an athletic apparel and shoe company which is getting ready to launch its first mobile application.
<br />

<h2>PASTA</h2>
The Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) is a risk-centric threat modeling process developed by two OWASP leaders and supported by a cybersecurity firm called VerSprite. It focuses primarily on discovering evidence of viable threats and representing this information as a model. The evidence-based design of PASTA can be applied when threat modeling an application or the environment that supports that application. Its seven-stage process consists of various activities that incorporate relevant security artifacts of the environment, like vulnerability assessment reports.


<h2>Stage I: Define business and security objectives</h2>
All shopping applications need to process payments. As such, certain technologies are required to keep information private and secure as well as be in compliant with PCI-DSS. Accordingly, the DevSecOps team will have to analyze the following requirements: 

- <b>Users can create member profiles internally or by
connecting external accounts.</b>
- <b>The app must process financial transactions.</b>
- <b>The app should be in compliance with PCI-DSS.</b>

<h2>Stage II: Define the technical scope</h2>

<h2>Stage III: Decompose the application</h2>

<h2>Stage IV: Threat analysis</h2>

<h2>Stage V: Vulnerability analysis</h2>

<h2>Stage VI: Attack modeling</h2>

<h2>Stage VII: Risk analysis and impact</h2>
